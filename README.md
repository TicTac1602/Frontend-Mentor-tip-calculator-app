## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Calculate the correct tip and total cost of the bill per person

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

On this challenge I really tried to make a pixel perfect look by using fixed dimensions. I know that it is not the best way to work as responsiveness is key nowadays. But trying to find the perfect fit was something i rarely made.

### Continued development

I plan to make a lot of those project in the future to be as good as I can on basic web app making. Then I will learn a JS library to make some VueJs or ReactJS.
